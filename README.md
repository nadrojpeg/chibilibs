**_chibilibs_** is a work-in-progress project consisting of small, minimalistic libraries written in C. It’s a personal project that I work on while studying and learning the C language, as well as topics related to algorithms and data structures. 
As I continue to develop my understanding of C and related concepts, this project will grow with new libraries and improvements.  
The name **_chibilibs_** is derived from the Japanese word "_chibi_" (ちび), which means "small" or "tiny". This reflects the project's focus on creating small and minimalistic libraries.

#### <u>_vectors.h_</u>: a type-generic dynamic array library
![Testing](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Testing-purple)  
A single-header, fast and lightweight macro-based implementation of dynamic arrays in C.  
Provides _C++_-like (_std::vector_) functionality for creating and manipulating dynamic arrays.

#### <u>_sorting.h_</u>: a type-generic sorting library
![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Work_in_Progress-red)  
A single-header implementation of a variety of sorting algorithms.  
The entire library is type-generic, which means you can sort all types of data by implementing a  
callback function to order those data types.
