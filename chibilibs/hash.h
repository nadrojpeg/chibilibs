 * WARNING:
 * This library has been tested and is officially supported only with the MSVC compiler
 * on the Windows platform.
 *
 * It relies on x86 SSE2 SIMD instructions for performance. Support for ARM SIMD
 * (e.g., NEON) is not currently implemented or planned in the short term.
 *
 * Currently, only `uint64_t` keys are supported. Support for other key types,
 * including `char *` strings, is planned for future versions.
 *
 * Cross-platform support is also planned, but at this stage the library is designed
 * and tested specifically for Windows/MSVC environments only.
 *
 *
 * This library would never have existed without the brilliant work of the SwissTable Team.
 * I first heard of their techniques in a blog post about HashBrown, a Rust port of the
 * SwissTable algorithm. After that I discovered that HashBrown was a reimplementation of the
 * Google team's work. I then watched the YouTube video presentation of the algorithm behind
 * SwissTable. Terrific work. I can't think of a better word than 'genius' when I think about
 * the ideas behind Google's algorithm.
 *

 * - https://faultlore.com/blah/hashbrown-insert/
 * - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncHmEUmJZf4&t=840s
 *
 * This implementation supports two types of keys: uint64_t and const char * (currently only uint64_t)
 * By casting char, uint8_t, int8_t, uint16_t, int16_t, uint32_t, int32_t, uint64_t, int64_t, and all kinds
 * of pointers to uint64_t this implementation offers a good deal of flexibility with integer keys.
 * String keys are a standard feature of hash maps.
 * I would like to implement a truly <generic key, generic val> hash map, but I don't really know
 * of an elegant or efficient way of doing this in pure C. I hope that my choice is not too restrictive
 * for future users' purposes.
 *
 * The SwissTable algorithm is built on an ingenious memory layout. This memory layout makes it possible to leverage
 * SIMD instructions (SSE2) and cache locality to achieve maximum performance. I'm new to SIMD (I
 * actually learned about SIMD by watching the YouTube video mentioned above), so this implementation may
 * not be perfect and the performance might not match the original SwissTable implementation.
 *
 * MEMORY LAYOUT:
 *
 * - An array of uint8_t metadata, divided into groups of 16 bytes. These metadata store information about each
 *   <key, value> slot: the current state (FULL, FREE, TOMB) and a 7-bit portion of the hash derived from the key.
 *   This memory layout is a core idea behind SwissTable's performance. The array is also aligned to allow efficient
 *   aligned loads into `__m128i` registers, thereby maximizing SIMD and cache performance.
 *   |    uint8_t group[16]    ||    uint8_t group[16]    ||    uint8_t group[16]    ||    uint8_t group[16]    || ...
 *
 * - An array of uint64_t keys. As mentioned before, I don't know of an elegant and efficient way to create a truly
 *   generic <key, value> hash map. To increase flexibility, I chose to use 64-bit keys that can store, via appropriate
 *   casting, any kind of 64-bit value â€” integers, floats, and pointers.
 *
 * - A struct that stores information about the entire map, such as its size, capacity, and the size in bytes of the value type.
 *
 * - An array that stores the user-provided values.
 *
 * The overall memory layout is:
 * | metadata[] | keys[] | info | user pointer -> values[] |
 *
 * Public macros and functions (to be used by the user):
 *
 * - hash_size: macro that "returns" the number of elements stored in the map.
 * - hash_capacity: macro that "returns" the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the map.
 * - hash_is_full: macro that checks whether a slot in the map contains a valid element (i.e., not deleted or free).
 * - hash_is_free: macro that checks whether a slot in the map is free and ready to be filled.
 * - hash_free: macro that frees the map's resources.
 * - hash_set_hash_seed: function used to set the seed that randomizes the hash function output
 * - hash_reserve: ensures the map has capacity for at least the specified number of elements, resizing the map if necessary to the next power of two.
 * - hash_get: function that returns a pointer to the element associated with a given key. Returns NULL if the element
 *   does not exist.
 * - hash_del: function that deletes the element associated with a given key. If the element does not exist, the
 *   function returns false; otherwise, it returns true.
 * - hash_put: macro that inserts a <key, value> pair into the map.
 *
 * Private macros and functions (should not be used directly by the user, unless they really want to):
 *
 * - hash__aligned_allocation: cross-platform aligned malloc macro.
 * - hash__aligned_free: cross-platform aligned free macro.
 * - hash__cast: macro that casts a pointer. This is required for C++ (in C, casting to void * is sufficient).
 * - hash__get_info: macro that "returns" a pointer to the `hash__info_t` structure.
 * - hash__get_keys: macro that "returns" a pointer to the first element of the keys array.
 * - hash__get_meta: macro that "returns" a pointer to the first element of the metadata array.
 * - hash__get_base: macro equivalent to `hash__get_meta`, used to improve clarity. The name `base` is used when
 *   performing allocation/deallocation, while `meta` is used when accessing metadata.
 * - hash__hash57: macro that extracts the 57 least significant bits from the computed hash value.
 * - hash__hash7: macro that extracts the 7 most significant bits from the computed hash value.
 * - hash__malloc: function that allocates a map with a given capacity.
 * - hash__init: macro that initializes the map to its initial capacity. A macro is used to infer the value type
 *   from the pointer type.
 * - hash__hash: the hash function used by this library.
 * - hash__rehash: function that performs rehashing after reallocating the map.
 * - hash__resize: macro that allocates a new map and rehashes the old one into it.
 * - hash__get_idx: function that searches for the position of the element associated with a given key. If found,
 *   returns true and stores the index in the provided `size_t *`. Otherwise, returns false, and the value pointed to
 *   is undefined.
 * - hash__get_freetombidx: function that returns the index of the first FREE or TOMB slot. The map is resized when its
 *   size exceeds 75% of its capacity, so it is guaranteed that at least one empty slot is available.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * The user must create a pointer to the value type they want to store in the map.
 * For example, to create a <uint64_t, type> map, they should initialize
 * a pointer like `type *tmap = NULL`. Then, this pointer can be passed to the
 * macros and functions to perform various operations.
 *
 * The hash function uses a global seed (`hash__seed`) to randomize its output.
 * This seed is defined as a static variable, so each translation unit (TU) has its own copy.
 * If multiple TUs operate on the same hash map, the user must ensure that the seed is
 * explicitly set to the same value in all of them using `hash_set_hash_seed()`.
 *
 * The library does not provide built-in thread safety. If hash maps are accessed
 * concurrently, it is the user's responsibility to enforce synchronization and ensure
 * consistent seed initialization across threads and compilation units.

/*
 * The hash_reserve function allocates space for the map to hold at least the requested capacity.
 * Internally, it always rounds up the capacity to the next power of two.
 * 
 * Because of this, to avoid unnecessary memory waste, users should ideally request capacities
 * close to powers of two. For example, requesting 17,000 slots will actually allocate 32,768 slots,
 * nearly doubling the space used and potentially wasting memory.
 *
 * Additionally, the map maintains a load factor of 75%, meaning that rehashing is triggered when
 * the number of stored elements reaches 75% of the capacity. Therefore, even with a capacity of
 * 32,768, only about 24,576 elements can be stored before resizing occurs.

 * Inserts or updates a <key, value> pair in the map.
 * If the map is NULL, initializes it first.
 * Uses a macro to support generic value types with minimal overhead.
 * Computes the hash and probes for an existing key or a free slot.
 * Inserts the new pair or updates the existing value.
 * Increments the size accordingly.
 * Automatically resizes the map when the load factor exceeds 75%.
 * Measures performance ticks for profiling.
